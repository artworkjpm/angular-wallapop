<h2>Things to mention:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    First problem I had was this error message about CORS:
    <code>
      No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested
      resource.</code
    >
    > I managed to get around that by using a <code>proxy.conf.json</code> file,
    NICE!
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Unit tests:</b><br />
    My main unit tests are for the
    <b>ApiService </b> - check GET request for url, favItems array ADD and
    REMOVE, <b>ItemsComponent</b> - should paginate in sections of 5 ,
    <b>FavIconComponent </b> - should return false if dummyItem is not in
    dummyFavItems (to control the styling of the heart icon)
  </li>
</ul>
